                <h4>UI / UX Design</h4>
                <p>Even though Vukasin majored in Photography, his portfolio is a unique set of UI design. He mainly focuses on brutalism and unique app/web ideas and comes up with unusual but beautiful ways to present them. He has worked amazingly as a graphic designer in over 3 companies. </p>

                <p>On his portfolio, Vukasin showcases a game design he made in December 2023. It is extremely remarkable for a major in photography to not only step their foot in something as complicated as Game Design but also complete the project on their own.</p>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>This visual piece by Vukasin Stancevic reflects a contemporary and bold approach to magazine design. The composition uses stark monochromatic tones to highlight the fluidity and dynamic forms inherent in modern structures.It resonates with the architectural theme, intertwining the precision of clean typography with the organic curves of the building. Published on 6 September 2019, the work demonstrates Stancevic's ability to capture the viewer's imagination through a minimalist yet powerful design narrative.</p>

            <h3>Vortex</h3>
            <p>Vukasin Stancevic's design captures the essence of 2V-P, a tool for dynamic live visual performances. The striking monochromatic swirls convey motion, embodying the software's capability to enhance live art. It promotes an engaging workshop, signaling 2V-P's commitment to interactive, creative experiences. Bold typography and a clear call to action make it a standout invitation to the world of new media.</p>

            <h3>Duality</h3>
            <p>This graphic design by Vukasin Stancevic serves dual purposes. On one side, it raises awareness about gender inequality in the music industry with a poignant question, and on the other, it promotes an empowering event by Razmasynth, focusing on building and hacking modular synths. The design is smart and intentional, using contrasting colors to differentiate the two themes. It is contemporary, eye-catching, and encourages engagement and reflection.</p>

            <h3>Convergence</h3>
            <p>Here we have a design that's both minimalistic and expressive, created by Vukasin Stancevic. It showcases the intersection of various creative disciplines, from architecture to package design, with a focus on industrial design. The chair and mirror symbolize functional art, serving as metaphors for design's practical and reflective nature. The grey tones and bold, overlaid text emphasize the sophistication and depth of these fields.</p>

            <h3>Pixelography</h3>
            <p>In this piece, Vukasin Stancevic offers a textured, digital mosaic that spotlights the work of artist Jun Seo Hahm. The pixelated portrait and typographic treatment suggest a blend of technology and artistry, fitting for Hahm's focus on digital expressions of biology-inspired life forms. The use of a monochromatic palette and scattered pixel patterns convey the complexity and intricacy of digital art.</p>

            <h3>Facade</h3>
            <p>Here we have a graphic design for a public exhibition called "Click". The design is modern and architectural, using sharp lines and bold typography to direct the eye. It integrates photography with graphic elements, creating a layered and textured appearance. The date range and location are prominently displayed, suggesting a temporary but significant event.</p>
